# Wordle

**Implemented a user input responding program based on the popular 5 letter guessing game**


### Game Process
The program picks a random 5 letter word from a file filled with them, and the user enters a 5 letter word which is validated.
- If the input word has a letter that exists in the random word and is placed exactly in the correct spot, the letter would be printed **green**.
- If the input word has a letter that exists in the random word and is incorrectly placed, the letter would be printed **yellow**.
- If the input word has a letter that does not exist within the random word, it would be printed out **regularly**.

The user wins if they guess the random word within 5 tries.
